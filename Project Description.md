# The-Repository-Seattle-Weather
The aim of this project is to se if it rains more in Seattle than it does in New York.
I will use the data science methodology to investigate whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in New York City, NY. The problem is simple; a lot of people think that it rains too much in Seattle, and refuses to visit me. I want to use data to determine whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in New York City, NY.

#Data
I will use daily precipitation measured in Seattle and New York from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2024. The data sets were downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA Climate Data)
