# The-Repository-Seattle-Weather
## Project Description
The aim of this project is to see if it rains more in Seattle than it does in New York.
I will use the data science methodology to investigate whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in New York City, NY. The problem is simple; a lot of people think that it rains too much in Seattle, and refuses to visit me. I want to use data to determine whether it rains more in Seattle, WA than in New York City, NY.

## Data
I will use daily precipitation measured in Seattle and New York from January 1, 2020 to January 1, 2024. The data sets were downloaded from the National Centers for Environmental Information [(NOAA Climate Data)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=GHCND)

## Data Preparation
I inspected the two datasets to see what information would be necessary to answer the the main question. Then, I merged both datasets retaining only the most important information.
More details about this process can be found in the Data Preparation Seattle Weather Project IPYNB file (Data_Preparation_Seattle_Weather_Project.ipynb) in this repository. The final csv dataset titled clean_seattle_ny_weather_dataset can also be accessed in this repository.

## Data Analysis
Using the cleaned data set (clean_seattle_nyc_weather.csv), I conducted an analysis to help me understand more about precipitation in both cities. In general, I searched for any patterns in precipitation each month over 4 years and for which city has more rainy days, heavier rain fall and I also explored the frequency of these heavier rainy days in each city. This analysis can be found in this repository in a file titled Project_1_Seattle_NYC_Weather_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb .
